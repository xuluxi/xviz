# Session Protocol Specification

XVIZ can be used to visualize data from a running system or logged data. In this contexts a client
connects to a server and establishes a session. At the start of the session the available streams
and parameters are setup.

## Server Types

XVIZ servers can exist in a variety of types that effect what transforms they can do on data, and
whether than be reconfigured. Typical types are:

- **dynamic-log** - these transform raw underlying data into XVIZ on demand, these can respond to
  all command types.
- **static-log** - serving static XVIZ data from a storage location, these cannot respond to any
  reconfigure commands
- **live** - embedded in a running system, these typically cannot respond to any transform commands,
  but can be reconfigured.

## Session Message Flow

An XVIZ client and server establish a session that is focused on data from a single log or live
scene. A session is first initiated by a client with some parameters, to which the server responds
with metadata. Then either streaming or on demand data transfer beings. Optionally clients can use
the unstable reconfiguration feature to change how the server is transforming data for the client.

The session protocol is currently defined, and designed, to operator over a WebSocket, or similar
reliable, in order, datagram based communications channel.

### Initialization

Each session is started by a client connecting to the server, in the WebSocket case this involves an
HTTP GET request that is upgraded by the server to a persistent WebSocket connection. Termination of
the connection terminates the session.

After connection is established client starts by sending the [`start`](#start) message, which sets
the type of session and various other parameters. In the WebSocket case you can send the
[`start`](#start) properties as URL parameters eliminating the need to send the message. The server
responds with a [`metadata`](#metadata) message that contains various information about the XVIZ
data the server can provide.

### Data Transfer - Live

Upon start of a live session the server will immediately, and continuously send the client
[`state_update`](#state_update) messages at an undefined rate.

Optionally the unstable [`reconfigure`](#reconfigure-warning-unstable-feature-) message can be sent
to the server to change future data send to the server.

### Data Transfer - Logs

To request log data the client starts with a [`transform_log`](#transform_log) request that
specifies the time range of the log to send back along with a request id. The server then responds
with an indeterminate number of [`state_update`](#state_update) messages. When complete it sends the
`done` message tagged with given request id.

Optionally the unstable [`reconfigure`](#reconfigure-warning-unstable-feature-) message can be sent
to the server to change way data is transformed for future requests.

### Data Transfer - Point In Time

To get a single picture of the world at a specific time the client sends a
[`transform_point_in_time`](#transform_point_in_time-warning-unstable-feature-) message, and the
server responds with a single [`state_update`](#state_update) containing a full world snapshot.

### Reconfiguration

Optionally the unstable [`reconfigure`](#reconfigure-warning-unstable-feature-) message can be sent
to the server to change way data is transformed for future requests. This can happen any time after
the connection has been initialized.

## Session Message Types

These describe client server communication to start and manage sessions.

### start

Sent by the client to the service or encoded as URL parameters. When the server gets this message it
will start streaming data to the client as soon as it can.

                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Request Messages

### transform_log

Sent from the client to the server to request part of the given log. The time bounds are optional,
and if not present entire log is sent. Using `requested_streams` you can have the server only send
streams you need, limiting data usage and potentially speeding up backend processing.

| Name                | Type                  | Description                                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                | `string`              | identifier used to track request, echo'd back upon completion.            |
| `start_timestamp`   | `optional<timestamp>` | Where to start transformation, inclusive, if not present use start of log |
| `end_timestamp`     | `optional<timestamp>` | Where to end transformation, inclusive, if not present use end of log.    |
| `requested_streams` | `list<string>`        | If non-empty, only send these streams.                                    |

### transform_log_done

Sent from the server to the client to indicate the completion of the
[`transform_log`](#transform_log) request. This is the only indicate that the request has completed.

| Name | Type     | Description                                                 |
| ---- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id` | `string` | identifier passed with the original `transform_log` request |

### transform_point_in_time (WARNING: unstable feature)

Sent from the client to the server to request a snapshot of a single point in time from a log. This
will contain the latest version of all streams, or the requested subset up to the `query_timestamp`,
inclusively. Using the `requested_streams` you can have the server only send streams you need,
limiting data usage and potentially speeding up backend processing.

| Name                | Type           | Description                                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                | `string`       | identifier used to track request, echo'd back upon completion.   |
| `query_timestamp`   | `timestamp`    | The point at time which to get the state of the desired streams. |
| `requested_streams` | `list<string>` | If non-empty, only send these streams.                           |

### reconfigure (WARNING: unstable feature)

Reconfigure messages allow for a client to change the configuration of a XVIZ server, affecting all
future requests for data from the server. This in turn enables a client to enable or disable
expensive to compute or transmit features.

A typical source for reconfigure messages would be a user selecting a new value in a
[declarative ui select component](/docs/declarative-ui/components.md#select-warning-unstable-feature-).
Which would send a `delta` reconfigure message to the server.

| Name            | Type                   | Description                                       |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `update_type`   | `enum { full, delta }` | Whether we have a complete or incremental update. |
| `config_update` | `object`               | A JSON patch or full configuration update.        |

## Core Types

### stream_metadata

Metadata provides information about the structure of a stream. Ideally redundant information is
removed from streams and put into metadata packets that are sent at the start of streaming or when a
reconfiguration happens.
